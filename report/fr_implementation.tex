\section{Implementation}

Our final artifact will include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Blueprint workflow code for our compressed object cache microservice.
    \item The Blueprint plugin code to wrap Intel's QPL library for utilizing the IAA (or performing (de)compression in software if the IAA is not present).
    \item The Blueprint scaffolding code for the monolithic and microservice configurations.
    \item The benchmark code for orchestrating the experiments and measuring the end-to-end latency, system throughput, and CPU utilization for the different deployments.
    \item Telemetry code for monitoring (de)compression operation size.
    \item Scheduler code for polling telemetry information and choosing to reconfigure and redeploy the application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Progress}

We have made significant progress on the project so far.
We spent substantial time getting familiar with Blueprint and reading through example microservices, but are now making good progress on the implementation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have implemented all of the Blueprint workflow code except for the actual calls to the compression library.
    \item We are currently implementing the Blueprint plugin code to wrap Intel's QPL library by implementing a C shim layer and using Go's FFI to call the shim layer.
    \item We have implemented the scaffolding code for building the application as a single process or as separate Docker containers communicating over gRPC.
    \item We have yet to implement the code to run the experiments and collect measurements.
    \item We have yet to implement the telemetry code for monitoring (de)compression operation size.
    \item We have yet to implement the scheduler code for polling telemetry information and making allocation decisions.
\end{itemize}
For our evaluation, we will be running on two Intel Sapphire Rapids servers, one with the IAA enabled and one without.
